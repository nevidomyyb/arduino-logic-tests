# Logic Tests for a Arduino Course

### 1. For loop

Print the odd numbers between 1 and 20 in descending order.

[Python file](./teste-arduino-1.py)


### 2. Conditional Structure

Given that sensorValue is a variable that stores the reading of a light sensor, write a condition that checks if sensorValue is between 400 and 600.

[Python file](./teste-arduino-2.py)

### 3. Avarage function

Write a function that accepts three integer values as parameters and returns the average of these values.

[Python file](./teste-arduino-3.py)

### 4. Palindrome function

Write a function that checks if a string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, punctuation and case differences. Later, modify the function to check if a string can be rearranged to form a palindrome.
(A palindrome is a word, phrase or number that remains the same when read from left to right, vice versa)

> [!WARNING]
> The second function isn't working and I did not finish it in time.

### 5. Interactive app

Imagine that you are developing a monitoring application for a smart vegetable garden, equipped with humidity, temperature and light sensors. Your task is to design an interactive menu for this application. How would you structure and implement a menu that allows the user to view the current sensor readings, adjust alert settings for each sensor (for example, set a minimum humidity threshold). Describe the logic of the menu, the options available to the user and how you would handle user input to navigate between the different functionalities of the application.

> [!WARNING]
> Working on that ü§ì‚úç It will be on a different repository

### 6. Calculator with 4 basic operations

Design a calculator that includes the four basic operations.

[Python file](./teste-arduino-6.py)

### 7. Letter counting

Implement a program that receives a string (simulating a sensor input in text format) and counts the number of times a certain letter appears in that string.

[Python file](./teste-arduino-7.py)

### 8. Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa

Implement a program that receives a string of characters (simulating input from a sensor in text format) and counts the number of times a given letter appears in that string.

[Python file](./teste-arduino-8.py)

### 9. Max, Min and Avarage Humity

Develop an algorithm that stores a series of humidity readings in an array. Calculate and display the average of these readings, identify and display the highest and lowest readings.

[Python file](./teste-arduino-9.py)
